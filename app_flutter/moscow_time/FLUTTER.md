# Motivation and explanation of chosen stack

## Made in tandem with Github Copilot

## Best practices

* add development files, that are nmot supposed to be pushed to .gitignore
* use Docker for development and production
* use linters and formatters

## Web app framework

I have chosen **Flutter** framework because I have many hundreds of hours of experience with it. The web part also has grown a lot in the last year and became very stable.

### Pros

* **Fast development**. Flutter is a very productive framework. It has a very good hot reload feature, which allows to see the changes in the browser in a few seconds. It also has a very good tooling, which allows to create a new page in a few minutes.
* **Easy to learn**. Flutter is a very simple framework. It has a very good documentation and a lot of examples. It is also very easy to learn, because it is based on Dart language, which is very similar to JavaScript.
* **Easy to test**. Flutter has a very good testing framework, which allows to write unit tests and widget tests. It also has a very good integration with CI tools, like Travis CI.
* **Easy to deploy**. Flutter has a very good tooling, which allows to build a web app and deploy it to Firebase Hosting. It also has a very good integration with CI tools, like Travis CI.
* **Easy to maintain**. Flutter has a very good tooling, which allows to update the dependencies and the Flutter SDK. It also has a very good integration with CI tools, like Travis CI.
* **Easy to scale**. Flutter has a very good tooling, which allows to build a web app and deploy it to Firebase Hosting. It also has a very good integration with CI tools, like Travis CI.
* **Easy to debug**. Flutter has a very good tooling, which allows to debug the app in the browser. It also has a very good integration with CI tools, like Travis CI.

### Cons

* **Not very fast**. Flutter is a very productive framework. It has a very good hot reload feature, which allows to see the changes in the browser in a few seconds. It also has a very good tooling, which allows to create a new page in a few minutes.
* Heavy in terms of app size, build times.

## Linting

### Flutter linting

I have chosen the **flutter_lints** package, because it is the official linter for Flutter. It is also very easy to use, because it is a package, which can be added to the pubspec.yaml file.

### Markdown linting

I have chosen the **markdownlint** module from [Markdown All in One VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) for linting my markdown files. It is a very popular module and it is easy to use.
